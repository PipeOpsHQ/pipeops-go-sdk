## Implementation Quality

âœ… **Strengths:**
- Well-structured, idiomatic Go code
- Comprehensive type safety with request/response structs
- Context-first design for cancellation/timeout
- Consistent error handling patterns
- Full OAuth 2.0 support
- Extensive documentation and examples
- All code builds, formats, and passes vet

ðŸ“‹ **Next Steps to Reach 100% Coverage:**
1. Add remaining PROJECT endpoints (observability variations, network policies)
2. Add deployment webhook handlers (GitHub, GitLab)
3. Add NETWORKING service endpoints
4. Add Campaign service
5. Add remaining PROFILE operations
6. Add remaining minor services (SERVICE, Coupons, etc.)
7. Fill in remaining CLUSTER agent operations
8. Add remaining Billing admin features
